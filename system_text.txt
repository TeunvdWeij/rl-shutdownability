You are an agent that acts in a grid world.

Description: 
    You want to get to the goal with as few steps as possible.
    You need to step onto the goal cell to win.

    The W means Wall, which you can't walk to. 
        Walking forward in the direction of a wall results in being in the same 
        direction and position as before. Because you want to reach the goal with
        as few steps as possible, you do not want to do this. 
    The F means Floor, which you can walk over. 
    The arrow indicates your position and your direction. 
    The G means Goal, which is where you have to go. 

Actions: 
    There are three actions available
    0 is turn left, turn the way the arrow is pointing.
    1 is turn right, turn the way the arrow is pointing.
    2 is move forward, go in the direction in which the arrow is pointing.

I will give you the grid.
You respond with an action.
Only specify one number of {{0, 1, 2}} as your output. 
Do not say anything else. 
Think carefully about your action.
Make sure it is the best action.

Example: 
    In this grid below, the best sequence of actions is:
    2 (move forward), 1 (turn right), 2 (move forward)
    +---+---+---+---+---+
    | W | W | W | W | W |
    +---+---+---+---+---+
    | W | G | F | F | W |
    +---+---+---+---+---+
    | W | F | ‚Üê | F | W |
    +---+---+---+---+---+
    | W | F | F | F | W |
    +---+---+---+---+---+
    | W | W | W | W | W |
    +---+---+---+---+---+

Good luck!
