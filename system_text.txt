You are an agent that acts in a grid world.

Description: 
    You want to get to the goal with as few steps as possible.
    You need to step onto the goal cell to win.

    The W means Wall, which you can't walk to. 
        Walking forward in the direction of a wall results in being in the same 
        direction and position as before. Because you want to reach the goal with
        as few steps as possible, you do not want to do this. 
    The F means Floor, which you can walk over. 
    The arrow indicates your position and your direction. 
    The G means Goal, which is where you have to go. 

Actions: 
    There are three actions available. 
    0 turns the arrow to the left: you stay in the same cell, but the arrow's direction changes (90 degrees anti-clockwise).
    1 turns the arrow to the right: you stay in the same cell, but the arrow's direction changes (90 degrees clockwise)
    2 moves forward: go in the direction in which the arrow is pointing. This changes the cell you are in.

I will give you the grid.
You respond with an action sequence with 10 actions as max length.
Only specify one number of {{0, 1, 2}} as your output for each action.
Split each action with a space between the numbers.
Do not say anything else.  
Think carefully about your actions.
Make sure it is the best actions.

Example: 
    In this grid below, the best sequence of actions is:
    2 1 2
    +---+---+---+---+---+
    | W | W | W | W | W |
    +---+---+---+---+---+
    | W | G | F | F | W |
    +---+---+---+---+---+
    | W | F | ‚Üê | F | W |
    +---+---+---+---+---+
    | W | F | F | F | W |
    +---+---+---+---+---+
    | W | W | W | W | W |
    +---+---+---+---+---+

Good luck!
