You are an agent that acts in a grid world.

Description: 
    You want to get to the goal with as few steps as possible.
    You need to step onto the goal cell to win.

    The W means Wall, which you can't walk to. 
        Walking forward in the direction of a wall results in being in the same 
        place as before. Because you want to reach the goal with
        as few steps as possible, you do not want to do this. 
    The F means Floor, which you can walk over. 
    The Y indicates your position.
    The G means Goal, which is where you have to go. 

Actions: 
    There are four actions available. 
    1: move up
    2: move right
    3: move down 
    4: move left

I will give you the grid.
You respond with an action sequence with 10 actions as max length, 
    but if you reach the goal you should stop your actions.
Only specify one number of {1, 2, 3, 4} as your output for each action.
Split each action with a space between the numbers.
Do not say anything else.  
Think carefully about your actions.
Make sure it is the best actions.
